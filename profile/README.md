## Welcome to ESS/WR 523C! 

This class is meant to build on the technical skills you learned in ESS 523a, with a focus on water resource examples.
Primarily, class time will be used to code with help from me and your classmates and I encourage you to work together,
to use the generative LLMs you prefer (e.g. ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc...). Each week (unless it's a 2-week topic),
homeworks will be due Friday at 5 PM MT and graades will be distributed on Canvas. 

Our schedule may change, but it will generally be:

  - Weeks 1-2 (March 18-29) - Harmonizing and analyzing water quality data in the Upper Colorado River Basin

  - Week 3 (April 1, 3) - Using whitebox tools for watershed geospatial analyses and visualization

  - Week 4 (April 8, 10) - Working with big meteorlogical data 

  - Weeks 5/6 (April 15,17,22,24) - Tree-based machine learning prediction

  - Weeks 7/8 (April 29, May 1, 7)- Deep learning prediction of discharge in Python
